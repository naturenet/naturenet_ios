Download Xcode from here: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/ or go to App Store search Xcode and install it (App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12).

Download the source code of this entire project from Github. Click "Download Zip" on the right on the Github page to download the code on your computer. Or, if you have git on your computer, you can pull/fork this respostory to your local computer.

Connect your registered iPhone, import the project to Xcode. You can double click "naturenet.xcodeproj" in the project directory.

Make sure you have signed in Xcode with your Apple developer account. Go to preferences -> Accounts -> Apple ID -> Enter your credentials. After your ID is authenticated, you should see "Univerity of North Carolina Charlotte" under your ID, click that and click "view details". Click "+" under signing identities, and select "iOS development", a valid identity should appear. If it does not, it probably means your account has not been added into the developer's program. Click "refresh" on the provisioning proflies, you should see a bunch of profiles. Now click done to finish every configuration page.

Now, you should see your iPhone is the target in Xcode, then click run(it is a play look button). Xcode will deploy the app on your phone.
